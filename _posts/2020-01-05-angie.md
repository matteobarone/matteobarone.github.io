<h2>brief</h2>
<p>Suite of web components that allow the user to follow a flow to book an hotel reservation</p>
<p>This components consume a REST API service made by another company, that provide all the necessary data for all the funnel</p>

<h2>technology</h2>
<p>Web components are made using the <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">web components</a> technology, that today is supported in all modern browsers</p>
<p>To generate the components we used a framework call <a href="https://stenciljs.com/">stenciljs</a>, from ionic team, that has a well done build system and treeshaking, and can help with some polyfills for the legacy browsers such as IE11</p>
<p>The components do not reach directly the API, but there is another layer of JS services between them and the backend, ensuring DRY code and reusability</p>
<p>The services are made using streams, with RxJS and observables, a good way to share the data.</p>

<h2>goal</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project is to share the components in more frontend context</p>
<p>They can be imported in every project, without depends in any framework or library, they simply work with a basic configuration</p>
<p>Components are made to be customizable and flexible with some input, and they support the multilanguage</p>

<h2>Main components</h2>
- <b>room list</b>: list of rooms with relative prices

- <b>room detail:</b> specific room with all details and prices for different rates

- <b>room rate:</b> detail of prices and sell conditions

- <b>calendar picker:</b> calendar with booking dates

- <b>basket:</b> summary of what the user has in cart

- <b>extra list:</b> list of possible extra to include in the reservation
