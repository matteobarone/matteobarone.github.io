<h2>brief</h2>
<p>Luceplan asked to redesign their website with a new and contemporary look.</p>
<p>The project had to be ready for the <b>salone del mobile 2017</b>, where luceplan was one of the main brands of <b>euroluce</b>, international exhibition of light and lamp design.</p>

<h2>technologies</h2>
<p>The peculiarity of this project was the CMS used: <a href="https://statamic.com/">statamic</a> is a flat CMS, based on files and not in DB.</p>
<p>Is dynamic, but can behave as a static website, using a sophisticated method of caching, to make the app become faster and performing.</p>

<h2>output</h2>
<p>The project started from the organisation of the contents, grouping them in macro areas, building the real website structure. From here we develop the UX.</p>
<p>Following the guidelines given from CCRZ, a swiss graphic design studio, we built the site with a fresher and cleaner look and feel, very photographic style, using beautiful photos of luceplan products.</p>
<p>Finally we implemented the SEO strategy and analytics, to optimise the website in google ranks.</p>
